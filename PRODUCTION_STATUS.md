### Edge Case Management
- **Scale Reveals Issues**: Problems invisible at single-zip scale become critical at production scale
- **Systematic Validation**: Comprehensive data analysis must precede feature development
- **User Domain Expertise**: Manual review with specific error identification drives precise fixes
- **Pattern-Based Solutions**: Fix categories of issues rather than individual cases

### Production-Ready Architecture
- **Foundation-First Development**: Reliable parsing and normalization before business logic prevents cascading errors
- **Visual Source Authority**: Council map analysis eliminates database inconsistencies
- **Territory Validation**: Enhanced filtering maintains data integrity for council reporting
- **Professional Output**: Commissioner-ready reporting format with clear action items
