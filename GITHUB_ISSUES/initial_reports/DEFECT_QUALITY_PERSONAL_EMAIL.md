# Minor Defect: QUALITY_PERSONAL_EMAIL Tag Not Applied

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Priority**: Minor  
**Status**: Identified, low impact

## Issue Description
Troop 180 Holden (Quinapoxet) has contact email "straightshooters@mail.com" but is not receiving the `QUALITY_PERSONAL_EMAIL` tag, despite the email appearing to be a personal/generic email rather than unit-specific.

## Observed Behavior
- **Unit**: Troop 180 Holden (Quinapoxet District)
- **Contact Email**: "straightshooters@mail.com"
- **Current Behavior**: No `QUALITY_PERSONAL_EMAIL` tag applied
- **Expected Behavior**: Should receive `QUALITY_PERSONAL_EMAIL` tag for non-unit-specific email

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Only 1 unit affected (Troop 180 Holden)  
- **User Impact**: Minimal - unit still receives other appropriate quality recommendations
- **Functional Impact**: Email continuity guidance not provided to this unit

## Technical Context
Location in code: `src/pipeline/analysis/quality_scorer.py` - Personal email detection logic in contact email scoring

## Root Cause Analysis Needed
The personal email detection patterns may not be catching "straightshooters@mail.com" pattern. Possible causes:
1. Domain ".com" not in personal domain list
2. Email pattern doesn't match current detection rules
3. Logic precedence issue with other email classification rules

## Resolution Priority
Low priority - does not affect core functionality. Can be addressed during next quality scoring enhancement cycle to avoid risk of introducing regressions.

## Risk Assessment
**LOW RISK** - Fixing this now could introduce regressions in other email detection logic. Better to address comprehensively during planned quality scoring improvements.
