# Minor Defect: QUALITY_POBOX_LOCATION Tag Not Applied

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Priority**: Minor  
**Status**: Identified, low impact

## Issue Description
Post 4879 Groton has unit-address containing only a PO Box address but no street address, yet is not receiving the `QUALITY_POBOX_LOCATION` tag. Instead, it receives `REQUIRED_MISSING_LOCATION`.

## Observed Behavior
- **Unit**: Post 4879 Groton
- **Unit Address**: "PO Box 314 Groton MA 01450" 
- **Current Tags**: `REQUIRED_MISSING_LOCATION`
- **Expected Tags**: Should include `QUALITY_POBOX_LOCATION`

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The presence of the town name 'Groton' in the unit-address field `"PO Box 314<br>Groton MA 01450"` may be preventing the PO Box detection logic from triggering properly.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Only 1 unit affected (Post 4879 Groton)
- **User Impact**: Minimal - Key Three will still be prompted to enter real street address
- **Functional Impact**: Quality scoring works correctly, just different tag classification

## Technical Context
Location in code: `src/pipeline/analysis/quality_scorer.py` - PO Box detection logic in meeting location scoring

## Resolution Priority
Low priority - does not affect core functionality or user experience. Can be addressed during next quality scoring enhancement cycle.

## Workaround
Current behavior is functionally correct - unit will still receive appropriate guidance to provide street address instead of PO Box only.
