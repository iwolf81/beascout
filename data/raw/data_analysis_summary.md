# BeAScout Data Analysis Summary

## Current Extraction Success Rates
- **Primary Identifier**: 100% (66/66) - Successfully parsing "Pack 0070 Acton-Congregational Church" format
- **Contact Email**: 83.3% (55/66) - Good extraction from mailto: links
- **Website**: 75.8% (50/66) - Good extraction from external links
- **Description**: 86.4% (57/66) - Good extraction from unit-description divs
- **Meeting Time**: 31.8% (21/66) - Partial success with regex patterns
- **Meeting Day**: 10.6% (7/66) - Limited success with regex patterns

## Critical Missing Fields (0% extraction)
- **Meeting Location**: 0% - No extraction logic implemented
- **Unit Composition**: 0% - Icon-based extraction not working
- **Contact Person**: 0% - Pattern not matching actual HTML structure
- **Phone Number**: 0% - Pattern not matching actual HTML structure

## Raw Content Pattern Analysis
From the sample data, contact information is clearly present in raw_content:

## HTML Structure Insights
1. **Unit names** are correctly extracted from h5 tags in parent containers
2. **Contact information** follows a consistent "Contact: Name" pattern
3. **Phone numbers** are in parenthetical format with area codes
4. **Addresses** appear to be present but not extracted (12 Concord Rd, 164 Newtown Rd, etc.)
5. **Meeting information** may be embedded in descriptions rather than structured fields

## Recommendations for Selector Improvement
1. Add regex pattern for "Contact: (.+)" to extract contact persons
2. Add regex pattern for phone numbers: `\((\d{3})\) \d{3}-\d{4}`
3. Examine address patterns for potential meeting locations
4. Review unit composition extraction - may need different selector strategy
5. Parse meeting info from description text where available

## Next Steps
1. Update extraction logic in analyze_data.py with improved patterns
2. Re-run analysis to validate improvements
3. Document refined completeness criteria based on actual data availability
