# Update documentation
- Update the documents listed below to reflect current design, processing, statistics, file hierarchy, etc.
- Read ~/Repos/ai-context/AI_INTERACTION_GUIDELINES.md entirely to understand how to update documents.
- Read each document entirely and think hard on how to make it completely accurate.
- Note that OPERATION_WORKFLOW.md is working correctly
  - I've been following it when executing pipeline and get expected results.
  - Docs that identify other doc files should include OPERATIONAL_WORKFLOW.md as well.
- With COLLABORATION_LOG.md, think hard about the lessons learned since the last update.
- Consider all these documents as a set that compliment each other.
