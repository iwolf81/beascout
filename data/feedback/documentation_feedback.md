# Documentation feedback
1. README.md, CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md - Correct quality scoring system; the 70/30 split is obsolete
2. README.md, CLAUDE.md - Add OPERATIONAL_WORKFLOW.md to list of documents
3. READMEmd - I corrected "Option 1: Full Pipeline from Fresh Scraping"; do NOT modify
4. ARCHITECTURE.md - Is "Pipeline Flow Architecture" section redundant to more detailed "Processing Pipeline" section
5. ARCHITECTURE.md - I removed redundant pipeline commands; I fixed them in README.md
6. PRODUCTION_STATUS.md - Almost every numerical statistic is incorrect. Examine every value in document and fix it.
7. SYSTEM_DESIGN.md - Re-examine every numerical statistic for accuracy and correct. For example, 169 unit emails are created, not 62 as written.
