# Letter grade removal

## Create new enhancement request to remove letter grading system.
- A review of the Quality Report spreadsheet by the Council's professional staff suggested that a bad letter grade would make Key Three leaders feel defensive, and thus work against the Council's goal of encouraging them to make useful updates to beascout.org.
- Preserve the numerical scoring system as it helps Council leaders prioritize the units that need their attention.
- In the "Quality Grade" column in the Quality Report spreadsheet, assign separate colors for the score ranges below. Select colors that represent severity of score (e.g., dark red for missing unit, red for 0-24, yellow for 70-79, green for 90-100)
  - 90-100
  - 80-89
  - 70-79
  - 60-69
  - 50-59
  - 25-49
  - 0-24
  - Missing unit (currently grade N/A)
