# Guidelines for Effective Information in BeAScout

## Consider non-native English speakers
- Spell out full names for days and months.
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in Description:
  - "Wednesday nights, 7-8:30pm, during the school year"
  - "The second and fourth Tuesday of every month"
- Avoid abbreviations that may cause confusion:
  - Use "Tuesday" instead of "Tues." or "T"
  - Use "Thursday" instead of "Thurs." or "Th"

## Specify complete location
- Provide facility name and street address that is correctly findable in map applications.
  - Good: St. Anne's Church basement, 75 King Street, Littleton MA 01460
  - Bad:  Camp Resolute (street address and town are missing)
- Avoid PO Box addresses for meeting locations as families need physical locations
- Include room numbers or specific areas when helpful:
  - "Fellowship Hall, First Baptist Church, 123 Main Street, Acton MA 01720"

## Use a unit-specific email address instead of a personal one
- The inbox for a unit-specific email can be monitored by multiple unit leaders.
  - Recommend providing three leaders with credentials.
  - The email address remains with the unit as leaders rotate out of the unit.
  - Examples:
    - Good: troop32-information@actonscouts.org, scoutmaster@westfordtroop437.us
    - Bad:  irawolf81@gmail.com, anthony.nardone.scouts@gmail.com
- Provide email address in Email field in BeAScout.
  - Refrain from providing a different email address in Description field.

## Meeting time format recommendations
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM designation
- Provide time ranges when meetings have defined start and end times:
  - "7:00 PM - 8:30 PM" instead of just "7:00 PM"
- Avoid 24-hour format which may confuse families unfamiliar with military time
- Include frequency information to help families plan:
  - "Every Tuesday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM"
  - "First and third Monday of each month, 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM"

## Contact information best practices
- Provide multiple contact methods when possible (email, phone)
- Ensure contact person information stays current as leaders change
- Include role designation to help families know who to contact:
  - "John Smith, Scoutmaster" instead of just "John Smith"

## Website and social media
- Maintain unit-specific websites with current meeting schedules and contact information
- Avoid linking to general council websites that don't provide unit-specific details
- Ensure website URLs are current and functional

## Description field content
- Provide informative details about the unit's program focus
- Include age ranges served and any specialty programs
- Mention accessibility accommodations if available
- For Venturing Crews: Clearly identify specialty areas (High Adventure, STEM, Arts, etc.)
