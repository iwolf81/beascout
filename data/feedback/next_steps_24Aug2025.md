‚è∫ Based on your earlier guidance, here are the next steps you outlined:

  Next Steps Summary

  1. Feedback Review Phase

  - Review emails and reports with unit leaders and council commissioner
  - Refine format and content according to received feedback
  - Current outputs ready for review: 24 Key Three emails in data/output/emails/ and district report in data/output/reports/

  2. Code Cleanup Phase

  Remove deprecated processing:
  - Legacy single-source scrapers in src/scrapers/ (base_scraper.py, beascout_scraper.py)
  - Unused prototype files and root-level temporary files
  - Old processing files (beascout_01720.html, processed_01720.json, etc.)

  Optimize efficiency:
  - Consolidate extraction logic
  - Remove redundant parsing functions
  - Streamline data flow

  3. Infrastructure Scaling Phase

  Multi-zip code processing:
  - Process all 72 HNE Council zip codes from data/zipcodes/hne_council_zipcodes.json
  - Critical requirement: Implement deduplication strategy for units appearing in multiple zip code queries
  - Storage optimization: Avoid duplicate unit processing across overlapping zip codes

  4. Deduplication Architecture

  Recommended approach:
  - Use existing primary identifier format: <unit type> <unit number> <chartered organization name> ## Units are commonly identified by <<unit type> <unit number> <town>>. There will never be a unit of the same type with the same number in the same town. Would using this identifier simplify processing? You already derive the town from multiple fields.
  - Store processed units in central registry to skip re-processing ## Agree
  - Track which zip codes each unit appears in for coverage verification ## Commissioner will track by town, not zip code.
  - Implement batch processing with shared browser sessions for efficiency

  The system is production-ready for these phases, with the dual-source integration, quality scoring, and automated reporting fully validated
  through end-to-end testing.

  Which phase would you like to tackle first? ## Let's do code clean up first

  ## Additional considerations
  1. I ultimately want create a browser-based dashboard that will run the pipeline periodically and on demand for a single town or all towns. This application would be deployed to DigitalOcean, where I have an account. That would impact how data is stored securely.
  2. Should we first discuss architecture for retrieving data for all towns or explore deploying a dashboard?
