Questions for Clarification

  Scraping Strategy

  - Should we scrape both sources simultaneously for each zip code?
    - Yes
  - Different mile radius preferences (beascout: 10 miles, joinexploring: 20 miles)?
    - Yes
  Data Integration

  - Are Explorer Posts/Clubs also subject to HNE Council territory filtering?
    - Yes
  - Do Explorer units follow the same Primary Identifier format (Post 123 Organization Name)?
    - Yes

  Reporting Integration

  - Include Posts/Clubs in the same district reports?
    - Yes
  - Any special considerations for Explorer unit scoring or recommendations?
    - No

  Key Three Verification

  - Do Explorer Posts/Clubs appear in the HNE_key_three.xlsx roster with the same structure?
    - Yes

  The beauty of this integration is that it leverages all our existing sophisticated logic (town
  extraction, HNE filtering, Key Three matching, quality scoring) while just expanding the data
  collection sources. Very efficient approach!

  What's your preference on the scraping strategy and integration approach?
    - Same as existing scraping and integration strategy as with beascout.scouting.org query results
    - Integrate all Scouting unit types together (i.e., district reports contain all unit types)
