Dear Pack 0001 Acton Key Three,

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 0001's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Pack's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 57.5% (Grade: F)** ## Let's NOT include the grade now. I think that won't be received well by the Key Three. It may be useful to the Council Office.

### ‚úÖ **Excellent - Information Available:**
- **Meeting Location**: 164 Newtown Rd, Acton MA 01720 *(Clear address provided)*
- **Contact Email**: pack1actoncommitteechair@gmail.com *(Unit-specific email - great for continuity!)*
- **Contact Person**: Peter Katsoulis *(Designated contact provided)*
- **Website**: http://www.pack1acton.com *(Pack-specific website available)*
- **Program Description**: "Pack One Acton is an inclusive Family Cub Scout Pack located in Acton, Massachusetts. We welcome all who are interested in joining." *(Welcoming and informative)*
- **Chartered Organization**: The Church of The Good Shepherd *(Clear sponsoring organization)*

### ‚ùå **Missing - Critical Information for Families:**
- **Meeting Day**: *Not specified - families need to know when you meet*
- **Meeting Time**: *Not specified - families need to know what time meetings start*
- **Phone Contact**: *No phone number provided for direct contact*. ## Have different sections for Missing Critical Information (MISSING_xxx) and Recommended Additional Information (QUALITY_xxx, RECOMMENDED_xxx).

## Recommendations for Improvement

### üî¥ **High Priority - Required Information:**

**1. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please provide your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Second Tuesday of each month, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")
- **Where to Update**: Contact the Council Office or update through BeAScout.org  ## Only the Key Three can make updates to BeAScout.org.

**2. Phone Contact** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding the Pack's phone contact or Cubmaster's number
- **Best Practice**: Use a number that will remain with the pack as leadership changes ## Phone number will never remain with a unit; the important thing is to update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., a different leader is handling inquiries)

### ‚úÖ **Already Doing Well:**
- **Unit-Specific Email**: Your pack1actoncommitteechair@gmail.com email is excellent! It stays with the unit as leaders rotate and can be monitored by multiple Key Three members. ## can be monitored by multiple unit leaders, not just key three members
- **Clear Meeting Location**: Street address helps families find you easily
- **Active Website**: Having pack1acton.com provides detailed information beyond BeAScout
- **Inclusive Description**: Your welcoming message helps families feel invited to join

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Consider Non-Native English Speakers:**
- Spell out full names for days and months
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in descriptions:
  - "Second Tuesday of every month, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Tues." or "2nd Tue"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)
- Include frequency information: "Every Tuesday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Your unit-specific email approach is perfect - keep using pack1actoncommitteechair@gmail.com
- Consider adding a pack phone number that stays with the unit ## Impossible recommendation to implement; remove it
- Ensure multiple Key Three members have access to the email account ## Ensure three unit leaders have access to email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Meeting Schedule**: Please provide your meeting day and time information
2. **Consider Adding Phone**: A pack contact number would help families connect directly ## Nope. Remove it.
3. **Review Annually**: We'll check back next year to see how your information looks ## Recommend to review information during the annual rechartering process.
