Dear Crew 6 Gardner Key Three (Rodney Philip Fagan, James Charles Powers, James Patrick Ganley),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Crew 6 Gardner's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your crew meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Please provide your meeting location with full street address (e.g., "123 Main St, Community Center, Gardner-American Legion Post #129")
- **Where to Update**: Log into BeAScout.org, search for your unit, and update the meeting location field

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your crew meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please provide your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")
- **Where to Update**: Log into BeAScout.org, search for your unit, and update the meeting time field

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**3. Email Continuity** *(Quality Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be a personal address, which may change when leadership rotates
- **Action**: Consider transitioning to a unit-specific email address for better continuity
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails stay with the crew as leaders change


## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in descriptions:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use crew-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
