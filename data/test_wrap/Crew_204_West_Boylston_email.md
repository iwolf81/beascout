## Recommendations for Improvement

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your crew meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please provide your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")
- **Where to Update**: Log into BeAScout.org, search for your unit, and update the meeting time field

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**2. Email Continuity** *(Quality Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be a personal address, which may change when leadership rotates
- **Action**: Consider transitioning to a unit-specific email address for better continuity
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails stay with the crew as leaders change


## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in descriptions:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use crew-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
