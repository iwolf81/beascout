Dear Pack 1 Acton Key Three (<name1>, <name2>, <name3>), ## specify their names here.

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 1 Acton's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

- **Meeting Time**: *Not specified - families need to know what time meetings start*

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**
- **Phone Contact**: *No phone number provided for direct contact*

## Recommendations for Improvement

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please provide your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Second Tuesday of each month, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")
- **Where to Update**: Update directly through BeAScout.org using your Key Three login credentials  ## I need to get a link to the update instructions and have it specified here

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**2. Phone Contact** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a current unit leader's phone contact
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

### âœ… **Already Doing Well:**
- **Unit-Specific Email**: Your pack1actoncommitteechair@gmail.com email is excellent! It stays with the unit as leaders rotate and can be monitored by multiple unit leaders.
- **Clear Meeting Location**: Street address helps families find you easily
- **Active Website**: Having pack1acton.com provides detailed information beyond BeAScout
- **Inclusive Description**: Your welcoming message helps families feel invited to join

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in descriptions:
  - "Second Tuesday of every month, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Tues." or "2nd Tue"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)
- Include frequency information: "Every Tuesday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Your unit-specific email approach is perfect - keep using pack1actoncommitteechair@gmail.com
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to

## Next Steps

1. **Update Meeting Schedule**: Please provide your meeting day and time information
2. **Review During Rechartering**: Recommend reviewing information during the annual rechartering process
