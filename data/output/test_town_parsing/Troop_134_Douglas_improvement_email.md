---

Dear Troop 134 Douglas Key Three (Ernest R Marks, Mary Elva St. Pierre, Donald Marchand),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 134 Douglas's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Troop's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 37.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Douglas - Fire Fighters Association *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: maryelva143@gmail.com *(Available)*
**Website**: http://www.douglasbsa.com *(Troop-specific website available)*
**Meeting Location**: 22 Church STREET PO BOX 898, Douglas MA 01516 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your troop meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a troop-specific email address (e.g., troop134douglas@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

**5. Program Description** *(Missing - Recommended)*

- **Best Practice**: Include highlights and special characteristics of your unit

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Troop-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
