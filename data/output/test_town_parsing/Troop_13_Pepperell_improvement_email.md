Dear Troop 13 Pepperell Key Three (Jason Adam Russell, Margaret Mary McGuire, Jeremy Paul Jenkins),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 13 Pepperell's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific

**5. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*

- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Troop-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
