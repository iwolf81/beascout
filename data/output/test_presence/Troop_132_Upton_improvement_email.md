Dear Troop 132 Upton Key Three (Laura Beth Chauvin, Megan  Ronzio, Paul A Chauvin),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 132 Upton's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**

- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Troop-specific email addresses when possible
