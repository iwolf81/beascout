**SUBJECT:** Pack 62 Shrewsbury - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Pack

---

Dear Pack 62 Shrewsbury Key Three (Linda J Josti, Jacquelyn  MacDonald, Robert William Parry-Cruwys),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 62 Shrewsbury's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Pack's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 62.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Shrewsbury - American Legion Ray Stone Post #238 *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: vendant875@gmail.com *(Available)*
**Website**: https://cubscoutpack62.wordpress.com/ *(Pack-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "Pack meetings - 7-8pm at Ray Stone Post Full agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FJG-Fclr3L2olU9wD5c7zRPzzpxYVCDa/edit" *(Welcoming and informative)*
**Meeting Location**: 2 School Street Ray Stone Post, Shrewsbury MA 01545 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your Pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day (e.g., "Every Thursday")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Pack-specific email address (e.g., pack62shrewsbury@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

**5. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
