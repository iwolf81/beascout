**SUBJECT:** Pack 39 Phillipston - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Pack

---

Dear Pack 39 Phillipston Key Three (Brian Scott Nason, Eric J Olson, Christopher  McGinn),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 39 Phillipston's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Pack's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 75.0%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Phillipston-Congregational Church *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: Pack39Phillipston@gmail.com *(Unit-specific email - great for continuity!)*
**Website**: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Pack39Phillipston/ *(Pack-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "Pack 39 has Pack Meetings on the 3rd Sunday of the month at 4:00pm" *(Welcoming and informative)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your Pack meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Update the Unit Meeting Address field with the full street address (e.g., "Boardwalk Campus School, 71-75 Spruce St, Acton MA 01720")

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
