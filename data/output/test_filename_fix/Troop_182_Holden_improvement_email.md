**SUBJECT:** Troop 182 Holden - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Troop

---

Dear Troop 182 Holden Key Three (Richard B Holden, Derek  Olson, Glenn Michael Sullivan),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 182 Holden's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Troop's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 37.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Holden - First Baptist Church *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: GSullivan@DavidClark.com *(Available)*
**Website**: https://www.facebook.com/HoldenBoyScoutTroop182/ *(Troop-specific website available)*
**Meeting Location**: 1216 Main ST Holden MA 1520 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your troop meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a troop-specific email address (e.g., troop182holden@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

**5. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

**6. Program Description** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Helps families understand what makes your troop special
- **Action**: Add a welcoming description of your unit's activities and culture to the Description field
- **Best Practice**: Include highlights and special characteristics of your unit

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Troop-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
