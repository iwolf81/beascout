Dear Troop 173 Webster Key Three (John Szymczak, Shawn David Young, David N Harelson),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 173 Webster's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.
