**SUBJECT:** Troop 107 Grafton - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Troop

---

Dear Troop 107 Grafton Key Three (Erik Clifton Coldwell, Kristen Michelle Zinkowsky, Christopher Charles Tedford),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 107 Grafton's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Troop's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 50.0%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Grafton - Congregational Church *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Website**: http://troop107.grafton-ma.org *(Troop-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "We meet on Tuesday nights from 7 to 8:30 PM." *(Welcoming and informative)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your troop meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Update the Unit Meeting Address field with the full street address (e.g., "Boardwalk Campus School, 71-75 Spruce St, Acton MA 01720")

**3. Contact Email** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need a way to ask questions and get information about joining
- **Action**: Please update the Contact Information field with a Troop email address (preferably unit-specific like troop107grafton@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Use a unit-specific email that can be monitored by multiple unit leaders

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Troop-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
