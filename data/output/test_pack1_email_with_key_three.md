## Recommendations for Improvement

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please provide your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")
- **Where to Update**: Update directly through BeAScout.org using your Key Three login credentials  ## I need to get a link to the update instructions and have it specified here

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**2. Phone Contact** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a current unit leader's phone contact
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)


## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in descriptions:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use pack-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to

## Next Steps

1. **Update Missing Information**: Please provide the critical missing information identified above
2. **Review During Rechartering**: Recommend reviewing information during the annual rechartering process
