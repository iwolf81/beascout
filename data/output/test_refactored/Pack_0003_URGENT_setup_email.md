Dear Pack 0003 Key Three (Keith Edward Boudreau, Desiree Elizabeth Plante),

The Heart of New England Council maintains records of all active units and their Key Three leadership. However, during our periodic review of unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org, we discovered that **Pack 0003 does not appear to have any online presence**.

## Your Pack's Current Online Status

**Overall Completeness Score: 0.0%**

### ❌ **No Information Available:**
**Pack 0003** does not appear to have any information on BeAScout.org or JoinExploring.org. Families searching for Scouting in your area cannot find your unit online.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Online Presence Setup Required

Without an online presence, **families cannot discover Pack 0003**.
- This impacts your ability to recruit new Scouts and families
**IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:**
1. **Set up your BeAScout.org presence** with complete unit information
2. **Add essential details** that families need to connect with your unit
3. **Verify your information** appears correctly in online searches

### 🔴 **Required Setup Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Critical)*
- Families need to know where your pack meets
- **Action**: Add the complete meeting address (e.g., "Community Center, 123 Main St, YourTown MA 01234")

**2. Meeting Schedule** *(Missing - Critical)*
- Families need to know when your pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Add meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Tuesday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

**3. Contact Information** *(Missing - Critical)*
- Families need a way to ask questions and get information about joining
- **Action**: Add a pack-specific email address and/or phone number

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Pack-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
