- **Where to Update**: Update directly through BeAScout.org using your Key Three login credentials

**2. Contact Email** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need a way to ask questions and get information about joining
- **Action**: Please provide a crew email address (preferably unit-specific like crew250sportsmensclub@gmail.com)

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in descriptions:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use crew-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to

## Next Steps

1. **Update Missing Information**: Please provide the critical missing information identified above
2. **Review During Rechartering**: Recommend reviewing information during the annual rechartering process
