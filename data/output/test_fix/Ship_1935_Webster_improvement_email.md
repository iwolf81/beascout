---

Dear Ship 1935 Webster Key Three (Kristopher E Daly, Christine Wanda Chamberland, Daniel P Scotti),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Ship 1935 Webster's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Ship's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 62.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Webster - Sailing Association *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: dan.scotti@scoutinghne.org *(Available)*
**Website**: https://www.wsasail.org/seascouts.html *(Ship-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "Sea Scout Ship 1935 was founded in the fall of 2023 with the Webster Sailing Association as its charter partner. We're focused on sailing but are into all things involving boats and water activities. We will spend our spring, summer and early fall at the WSA facility located at 4 Bates Point Road in Webster. Our off season meetings are at the 200 Sportsmans Club also in Webster. We meet weekly on Tuesday nights starting at 6:30 PM. We also get together on weekends for all kinds of fun activities" *(Welcoming and informative)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your Ship meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Update the Unit Meeting Address field with the full street address (e.g., "Boardwalk Campus School, 71-75 Spruce St, Acton MA 01720")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Ship-specific email address (e.g., ship1935webster@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
