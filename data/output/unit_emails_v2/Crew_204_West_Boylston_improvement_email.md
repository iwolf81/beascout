**SUBJECT:** Crew 204 West Boylston - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Crew

---

Dear Crew 204 West Boylston Key Three (Jason Arthur Kunst, Mark George Jerome, Shawn Robert Archambeault),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Crew 204 West Boylston's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Crew's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 50.0%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
- **Chartered Organization**: West Boylston-American Legion Post 204 *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
- **Contact Email**: jason@micro-monkey.com *(Available)*
- **Website**: https://www.facebook.com/groups/venturecrew204 *(Crew-specific website available)*
- **Program Description**: "Backpacking, hiking, camping, whitewater, range and target activities. Greater New England activities overnights in the white mountains! Canoe the Maine woods. Visit the Adirondacks." *(Welcoming and informative)*
- **Meeting Location**: 159 Hartwell St West, Boylston MA 01583 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your crew meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a crew-specific email address (e.g., crew204west boylston@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Crew-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
