Dear Pack 37 Bolton Key Three (Duncan Robertson, Sean F. Thompson, Curtis  Roemer, Kristine Patricia Whittemore, Anthony Robert Penny, Daniel  Shaw),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 37 Bolton's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*

- **Action**: Consider creating a simple website or social media page with unit information

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Pack-specific email addresses when possible
