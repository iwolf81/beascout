Dear Post 2012 Holden Key Three (Riley  Holm, Jeremy Paul Laflamme),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Post 2012 Holden's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Post's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 25.0%**

### ✅ **Good Information Available:**
- **Chartered Organization**: Holden - Fire Department *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
- **Meeting Location**: 1370 Main Street, Holden MA 01520 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### 🔴 **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your post meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

**3. Contact Email** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need a way to ask questions and get information about joining
- **Action**: Please update the Contact Information field with a Post email address (preferably unit-specific like post2012holden@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Use a unit-specific email that can be monitored by multiple unit leaders

### 🟡 **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

**5. Website** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Allows families to learn more about your unit's activities and culture
- **Action**: Consider creating a simple website or social media page with unit information
- **Best Practice**: Update the Contact Information field with the unit's website

**6. Program Description** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Helps families understand what makes your post special
- **Action**: Add a welcoming description of your unit's activities and culture to the Description field

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Post-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
