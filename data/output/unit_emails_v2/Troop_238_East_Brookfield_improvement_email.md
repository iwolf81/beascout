---

Dear Troop 238 East Brookfield Key Three (Scott William Norrie, Paul Arthur Davidson, Jason M Dumas),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 238 East Brookfield's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Troop's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 12.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
- **Chartered Organization**: E Brookfield - Howe Lumber Co Inc *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
- **Contact Email**: Biggmixx63@gmail.com *(Available)*
- **Program Description**: "Founded in 1982, Troop 238 has produced over 30 Eagle scouts and has delivered a quality scouting experience to over 200 young men." *(Welcoming and informative)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your troop meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Update the Unit Meeting Address field with the full street address (e.g., "Boardwalk Campus School, 71-75 Spruce St, Acton MA 01720")

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your troop meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a troop-specific email address (e.g., troop238east brookfield@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

**5. Website** *(Missing - Recommended)*

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Troop-specific email addresses when possible
