---

Dear Pack 107 Grafton Key Three (Erik Clifton Coldwell, Farokh  Bhada, Lawrence Joseph Drew),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 107 Grafton's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Pack's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 25.0%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
- **Chartered Organization**: Grafton - Congregational Church *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
- **Contact Email**: graftonpack107@gmail.com *(Unit-specific email - great for continuity!)*
- **Website**: http://graftonpack107.org *(Pack-specific website available)*
- **Program Description**: "Where Boys & Girls can connect with Friends, Family and Nature while learning character development, physical fitness, and citizenship!" *(Welcoming and informative)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your troop meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Update the Unit Meeting Address field with the full street address (e.g., "Boardwalk Campus School, 71-75 Spruce St, Acton MA 01720")

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Pack-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
