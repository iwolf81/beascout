Dear Pack 46 Jefferson Key Three (Mary-Elizabeth  Monroy, Tanya Jolene Kakalecz, Jonathan  Buck),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 46 Jefferson's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

**Overall Completeness Score: 75.0%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
- **Chartered Organization**: Jefferson - Saint Marys Church *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
- **Contact Email**: pack46jefferson@gmail.com *(Unit-specific email - great for continuity!)*
- **Program Description**: "We are a family pack, accepting both boys and girls. We generally meet twice monthly in age specific groups(days are determined by the group) and then monthly, on a Friday or Saturday at St. Mary's Church in Jefferson." *(Welcoming and informative)*
- **Meeting Location**: 114 Princeton Street, Jefferson MA 01522 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting time (e.g., "7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

**5. Website** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Allows families to learn more about your unit's activities and culture
- **Action**: Consider creating a simple website or social media page with unit information
- **Best Practice**: Update the Contact Information field with the unit's website

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Pack-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
