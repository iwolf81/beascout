Dear Troop 281 Ware Key Three (Daniel Coleman Witt, Marretje  Chartier, Karen A Hoyt),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org and JoinExploring.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 281 Ware's online presence and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Troop's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 75.0%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Ware - AMVETS Post 2577 *(Clear sponsoring organization)*

**Meeting Location**: 45 Maple St American Legion Hall, Ware MA 01082 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

- Families need a way to ask questions and get information about joining
- **Action**: Please update the Contact Information field with a Troop email address (preferably unit-specific like troop281ware@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Use a unit-specific email that can be monitored by multiple unit leaders

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

- **Action**: Consider creating a simple website or social media page with unit information
- **Best Practice**: Update the Contact Information field with the unit's website

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Prove a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use Troop-specific email addresses when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
