# BeAScout Unit Information Analyzer

Comprehensive data validation and audit platform for Scouting America unit information across [beascout.scouting.org](https://beascout.scouting.org/) and [joinexploring.org](https://joinexploring.org/) for the Heart of New England Council (Massachusetts). This system provides data quality auditing, discrepancy detection, and automated reporting for council leadership.

## Overview

The BeAScout system performs three-way validation between the official Key Three database (169 units) and web presence data to identify units missing from online platforms or requiring data updates. Built with production-ready parsing and normalization capabilities, it processes all 72 HNE zip codes (2,034 raw scraped units) with 100% parsing success and 92% deduplication accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Source Data Collection**: Browser automation for beascout.scouting.org (10-mile radius) and joinexploring.org (20-mile radius) with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Production-Scale Processing**: Handles all 72 HNE zip codes with 152 unique units identified from 2,034 raw scraped records
- **Sophisticated Town Extraction**: 6-pattern address parsing with territory validation to exclude non-HNE units (Uxbridge MA, Putnam CT)
- **Consistent Unit Normalization**: Standardized unit_key format enables reliable cross-source matching and deduplication
- **Three-Way Validation**: BOTH_SOURCES (142 units), KEY_THREE_ONLY (27 units), WEB_ONLY (10 units) classification
- **Visual District Mapping**: HNE council map analysis eliminates "Special 04" database inconsistencies
- **Enhanced HNE Filtering**: Unit_town prioritization over chartered org matching for accurate territory classification

## Data Sources

- **beascout.scouting.org**: Cub Scout Packs, Scout Troops, Venturing Crews, Sea Scout Ships
- **joinexploring.org**: Exploring Posts and Clubs
- **Heart of New England Council**: Unit Key Three member contact lists

## Council Structure

The Heart of New England Council is comprised of two Districts:
- **QUINAPOXET District** (blue on council map): Northern and central Massachusetts towns
- **SOARING EAGLE District** (red on council map): Southern and western Massachusetts towns

Each District contains multiple towns, and each town may have zero or more Scout units. The BeAScout system processes units from both districts across all council territory.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

### Email Classification System
- **Challenge**: Distinguishing personal vs unit-specific emails (e.g., "sudburypack62@gmail.com" vs "john.smith@gmail.com")
- **Solution**: 5-tier precedence system with unit number detection and role pattern matching
- **Key Learning**: Unit numbers in email addresses (even with leading zeros) are strong indicators of unit-specific emails
- **Best Practice**: Always include organization name validation to handle duplicate unit numbers across different chartered organizations

### Organization Matching Logic
- **Challenge**: Multiple units sharing same numbers across different organizations (e.g., Troop 7012 in both Acton and Leominster)
- **Solution**: Two-stage matching with keyword extraction and flexible threshold requirements
- **Key Learning**: Stop words ("of", "the", "inc") must be filtered, but meaningful terms ("acton", "group", "citizens") provide reliable matching
- **Best Practice**: Extract organization keywords and require minimum match threshold rather than exact string matching

### Manual Review Framework
- **Challenge**: Validating 62 units worth of email classifications and scoring accuracy
- **Solution**: Systematic 5-pass review process with direct annotation in feedback files
- **Key Learning**: Commit-before-fix pattern enables easy change tracking and rollback
- **Best Practice**: Structure feedback as pass-by-pass annotations with specific index references for systematic improvement

### Data Quality and Edge Cases
- **Discovery**: Meeting times in formats like "330" (3:30 PM) and "1230" (12:30 PM) required enhanced parsing
- **Solution**: Regex patterns for 3-4 digit time formats with AM/PM inference
- **Key Learning**: Real-world data contains more format variations than initial assumptions
- **Best Practice**: Build parsing systems incrementally based on actual data patterns, not theoretical specifications

### Production Readiness Assessment
- **Metric**: 61.0% average unit completeness score across 62 units
- **Validation**: 98%+ Key Three cross-referencing accuracy (1 miss out of 62 units)
- **Scalability**: System handles duplicate unit numbers, missing data, and format variations reliably
- **Recommendation**: Ready for deployment across all ~200 HNE Council units

## Development

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.8+** with Playwright for dynamic web scraping
- **BeautifulSoup** for HTML parsing and data extraction
- **pandas + openpyxl** for Excel file processing (Key Three roster)
- **JSON** for raw data storage and configuration
- **Regex** for sophisticated pattern matching and text extraction
- **pytest** for automated testing (future implementation)

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Separate extraction, scoring, and email generation components
- **Data Pipeline**: Raw → Processed → Scored → Reports workflow
- **Manual Review Integration**: Direct feedback annotation system for continuous improvement
- **Production Safety**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
