**SUBJECT:** Pack 26 Barre - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Pack

---

Dear Pack 26 Barre Key Three (Edward Ross, Brandon W Carter, Mark Myers),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 26 Barre's presence in BeAScout and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Pack's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 37.5%**

### ✅ **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Barre-American Legion Post #2 *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: bruinsfan33@gmail.com *(Available)*
**Website**: https://www.troopwebhostcs.org/Pack26Barre/Index.htm *(Pack-specific website available)*
**Meeting Location**: 450 South Barre Road Po Box 278, Barre MA 01005 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### 🔴 **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your Pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### 🟡 **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Pack-specific email address (e.g., pack26barre@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

**5. Program Description** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Helps families understand what makes your Pack special
- **Action**: Add a welcoming description of your unit's activities and culture to the Description field
- **Best Practice**: Include highlights and special characteristics of your unit

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Provide a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
