---

Dear Troop 175 Holden Key Three (Ruth Gutierrez, Edward Perez, Brian Sanders),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 175 Holden's presence in BeAScout and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Troop's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 62.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Holden - Immanuel Lutheran Church *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: Adam@currier.us *(Available)*
**Website**: http://www.troop175holden.org/ *(Troop-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "Troop 175 is an active midsize Scout-Led Troop that travels, camps or hikes at least once a month. Wednesday Eves 7:00-8:30pm. Welcome!" *(Welcoming and informative)*
**Meeting Location**: 346 Shrewsbury Street, Holden MA 01520 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your Troop meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day (e.g., "Every Thursday")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Troop-specific email address (e.g., troop175holden@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

**5. Phone Number** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Provides families an immediate way to get questions answered
- **Action**: Consider adding a phone number to the Contact Information field
- **Best Practice**: Update BeAScout whenever the phone number needs to change (e.g., when a different leader handles inquiries)

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Provide a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
