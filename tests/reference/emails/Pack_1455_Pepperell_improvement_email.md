**SUBJECT:** Pack 1455 Pepperell - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Pack

---

Dear Pack 1455 Pepperell Key Three (Justin J Collins, Samuel F Morgan, Frances Rivera),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 1455 Pepperell's presence in BeAScout and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Pack's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 12.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Veterans Of Foreign Wars Pepperell Post #3291 *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: katjbelliveau@gmail.com *(Available)*
**Website**: http://pack1455.org/ *(Pack-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "Pack 1455 is a family oriented pack, boys and girls in grades K-5 are welcome to join! We invite you and your child to join us at an upcoming Den or Pack meeting to experience the fun of Cub Scouting and meet our leaders. Dens (by grade) meet twice a month to work on grade appropriate skills, and the entire Pack (all grades) meets at least once a month. Pack adventures include hiking, fishing, camping, and outings." *(Welcoming and informative)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your Pack meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Update the Unit Meeting Address field with the full street address (e.g., "Boardwalk Campus School, 71-75 Spruce St, Acton MA 01720")

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your Pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Pack-specific email address (e.g., pack1455pepperell@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Provide a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
