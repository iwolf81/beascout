**SUBJECT:** Crew 6 Gardner - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Crew

---

Dear Crew 6 Gardner Key Three (Samantha Roberts, Donna V Baker, Angela Ruiz),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Crew 6 Gardner's presence in BeAScout and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Crew's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 30.0%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Gardner-American Legion Post #129 *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: jpganley@gmail.com *(Available)*
**Website**: http://gardnerventuring.org *(Crew-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "https://www.facebook.com/gardnerventuring Crew 6 welcomes young people of all genders ages 14 through 20 with a passion for outdoor adventures." *(Welcoming and informative)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**1. Meeting Location** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families need to know where your Crew meets to attend meetings and events
- **Action**: Update the Unit Meeting Address field with the full street address (e.g., "Boardwalk Campus School, 71-75 Spruce St, Acton MA 01720")

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your Crew meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Crew-specific email address (e.g., crew6gardner@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Provide a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to

2. **How to Update BeAScout**:
