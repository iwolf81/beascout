**SUBJECT:** Troop 9 Gardner - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Troop

---

Dear Troop 9 Gardner Key Three (Douglas U Howard, Tyler J Foster, George Rogers),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Troop 9 Gardner's presence in BeAScout and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Troop's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 37.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Gardner-Annunciation Parish *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: baczewskiphillip@gmail.com *(Available)*
**Program Description**: "We are Troop 9 in Gardner MA, Our focus is to provide a Fun and educational environment that will keep kids coming back and enjoying scouts" *(Welcoming and informative)*
**Meeting Location**: 135 Nichols St, Gardner MA 01440 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your Troop meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Troop-specific email address (e.g., troop9gardner@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

**5. Website** *(Missing - Recommended)*
- Allows families to learn more about your unit's activities and culture
- **Action**: Consider creating a simple website or social media page with unit information
- **Best Practice**: Update the Contact Information field with the unit's website

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Provide a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to
