**SUBJECT:** Pack 26 Boxborough - BeAScout Information Review - Help Families Find Your Pack

---

Dear Pack 26 Boxborough Key Three (Thomas Rivera, Aaron Jackson, Sandra Baker),

The Heart of New England Council periodically reviews unit information on BeAScout.org to help prospective Scout families easily find complete, accurate information about local units. We've completed a review of Pack 26 Boxborough's presence in BeAScout and wanted to share our findings and recommendations.

## Your Pack's Current Information Quality

**Overall Completeness Score: 37.5%**

### âœ… **Good Information Available:**
**Chartered Organization**: Boxborough-District Minutemen Inc *(Clear sponsoring organization)*
**Contact Email**: ericwhitney@pack26boxborough.org *(Available)*
**Website**: http://www.abscouts.com *(Pack-specific website available)*
**Program Description**: "We have families from within and around Boxborough and Acton. It's a wonderful group of K through 5th graders who have joined us and we look forward to welcoming you and your family to Scouting!! Call or write if you have any questions!" *(Welcoming and informative)*
**Meeting Location**: 493 Mass Ave Rt 111, Boxborough MA 01719 *(Complete address provided)*

## Recommendations for Improvement:

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority - Missing Critical Information:**

**2. Meeting Day & Time** *(Missing - Required)*
- Families searching for Scouting need to know when your Pack meets to plan their schedule
- **Action**: Please update the Description field with your regular meeting day and time (e.g., "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM")

### ðŸŸ¡ **Recommended - Additional Information:**

**4. Professional Email Address** *(Recommended Improvement)*
- Current email appears to be personal rather than unit-specific
- **Action**: Consider creating a Pack-specific email address (e.g., pack26boxborough@gmail.com)
- **Best Practice**: Unit-specific emails provide better continuity and can be monitored by multiple leaders

## Guidelines for Effective BeAScout Information

### **Provide a welcoming and informative description**
- Describe the type of activities your unit does in the Description field.
- Identify highlights and special characteristics of your unit

### **Spell out full names for days and months:**
- Include clearly defined meeting day, time, and frequency in the Description field:
  - "Every Thursday, 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM, during the school year"
  - Avoid abbreviations like "Thurs." or "Thu"

### **Meeting Information Best Practices:**
- Populate the Unit Meeting Address field
- Use consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) for meeting times
- Include frequency information: "Every Thursday" or "First and third Monday of each month"
- Provide both start and end times when possible

### **Contact Information Continuity:**
- Use a unit-specific email address when possible
- Ensure three unit leaders have access to the email account to ensure inquiries are promptly responded to

## Next Steps

2. **How to Update BeAScout**:
