- **Specialty Fields**: Proper separation for Crews
- **Location Formatting**: Standardized address format with validation

## Key Technical Achievements

### Extraction Pattern Improvements
```python
# Enhanced meeting day patterns
day_patterns = [
    r'meets?\s+(?:most\s+)?(?:on\s+)?([A-Za-z]+day)s?',  # "meets most Wednesdays"
    r'([A-Za-z]+day)s?\s+(?:at|from|nights?)',  # "Wednesday nights"
    r'(?:first|second|third|fourth|1st|2nd|3rd|4th|last)\s+([A-Za-z]+day)',  # "1st & 3rd Tuesday"
]

# Enhanced time patterns with range support  
time_patterns = [
    r'(\d{1,2}:\d{2})\s*-\s*(\d{1,2}:\d{2})\s*([ap])\.?m?\.?',  # "7:00 - 8:30 p.m."
    r'(?:at\s+)?(\d{1,2}:\d{2})\s*([ap])\.?m?\.?',  # "at 6:30pm"
]

# Crew specialty parsing
if unit_type == 'Crew':
    clean_org, specialty = parse_crew_specialty(full_name, chartered_org)
```

### Data Validation Improvements
- Invalid location filtering (unit numbers as addresses)
- Phone number standardization: (XXX) XXX-XXXX format
- Website filtering (exclude registration URLs)
- PO Box location exclusion

## Files & Current Implementation

### Core Scripts
- **`prototype/extract_all_units.py`** - Main extraction script with refined patterns
- **`prototype/extract_hne_towns.py`** - Council territory analysis (62 towns, 72 zip codes)
- **`prototype/`** - 8 working prototype files organized for clear development phases

### Data Assets
- **`data/raw/debug_page_01720.html`** - Source HTML (66 units from beascout.scouting.org)
- **`data/zipcodes/hne_council_zipcodes.json`** - Complete HNE council ZIP code mapping
- **`data/input/HNE_council_map.png`** - District boundary reference
- **`data/input/HNE_key_three.xlsx`** - Unit leadership contact lists

### Documentation Hierarchy
- **`README.md`** - Project introduction, installation, usage examples
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - AI context, technical constraints, development patterns  
- **`SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`** - Master requirements, business workflows, success metrics
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Technical design, database schema, implementation details
- **`COLLABORATION_LOG.md`** - Evolution of AI-human collaboration through 8 phases

## Decision Point: Next Phase Priority

### Option 1: Scale Scraping System (Technical Path)
**Objective**: Process all 72 zip codes to capture complete HNE Council unit data
**Estimated Scope**: 124-248 total units across full council territory
**Implementation**: Multi-zip scraping with conservative rate limiting

**Files to Build**:
- `scrape_all_zipcodes.py` - Multi-zip coordinator with progress tracking
- `src/storage/sqlite_handler.py` - Cross-zip deduplication database
- `src/analysis/completeness_analyzer.py` - Quality scoring system

### Option 2: Build Recommendation System (Business Path)  
**Objective**: Generate improvement recommendations for Key Three members
**Current Data**: 62 validated units ready for quality analysis
**Implementation**: Completeness scoring and targeted email generation

**Files to Build**:
- `src/analysis/quality_scorer.py` - A-F grading system implementation
- `src/notifications/key_three_emailer.py` - Targeted improvement emails
- `report_generator.py` - Unit-specific improvement recommendations

## Technical Architecture Status

### Scraping Strategy (Conservative Approach)
- **Rate Limiting**: 8-12 second delays between requests
- **Detection Avoidance**: Human-like patterns, session limits, cooling periods
- **Recovery System**: Exponential backoff, session resets, checkpoint saves
- **Monitoring**: Progress tracking, error logging, completion verification

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
Raw HTML â†’ JSON extraction â†’ SQLite deduplication â†’ Quality analysis â†’ Key Three reports
```

### Quality Scoring Framework (Designed)
- **Required Fields (70%)**: meeting_location, meeting_day, meeting_time, contact_email, unit_composition
- **Recommended Fields (30%)**: contact_person, phone_number, website, description
- **Grade Scale**: A (90%+), B (80-89%), C (70-79%), D (60-69%), F (<60%)

## Development Environment
```bash
# Current working state
cd beascout/
python prototype/extract_all_units.py  # Generate refined unit data
python prototype/extract_hne_towns.py  # Council analysis

# Dependencies installed
pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml --break-system-packages
```

## Success Metrics Achieved
- âœ… **Manual Review Process**: Direct annotation feedback loop established
- âœ… **Extraction Quality**: Time formatting fixed, pattern recognition enhanced
- âœ… **Documentation Structure**: Clear hierarchy prevents content overlap
- âœ… **Council Scope**: Complete territory mapping (62 towns, 72 zip codes)
- âœ… **Authority Established**: Board member access rights documented
- âœ… **Conservative Strategy**: Detection avoidance approach designed

## Context for Future Sessions

### Current Achievement
Successfully evolved from **single zip code prototype** to **production-ready extraction system** with refined patterns, manual review validation, and comprehensive documentation architecture.

### Strategic Position
- **Foundation Complete**: Extraction system validated and ready to scale
- **Business Context**: Board authority established, conservative approach designed
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive requirements and technical specifications
- **Quality Assurance**: Manual review process with direct annotation feedback

### Next Session Priorities
**Primary Decision**: Scale technical infrastructure (all 72 zip codes) OR build business value system (Key Three recommendations)

**User Context**: Approaching usage limits, requiring strategic choice between technical scaling and business implementation paths.

**Readiness Level**: All foundational work complete for either direction.
