- `report_generator.py` - Unit-specific improvement recommendations

## Technical Architecture Status

### Scraping Strategy (Conservative Approach)
- **Rate Limiting**: 8-12 second delays between requests
- **Detection Avoidance**: Human-like patterns, session limits, cooling periods
- **Recovery System**: Exponential backoff, session resets, checkpoint saves
- **Monitoring**: Progress tracking, error logging, completion verification

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
Raw HTML → JSON extraction → SQLite deduplication → Quality analysis → Key Three reports
```

### Quality Scoring Framework (Designed)
- **Required Fields (70%)**: meeting_location, meeting_day, meeting_time, contact_email, unit_composition
- **Recommended Fields (30%)**: contact_person, phone_number, website, description
- **Grade Scale**: A (90%+), B (80-89%), C (70-79%), D (60-69%), F (<60%)

### August 29, 2025 Session - CRITICAL REGRESSION IDENTIFIED

**🚨 EMERGENCY STATUS: System Regression Analysis**

**Working Baseline**: `unit_identifier_debug_scraped_20250828_085755_u.log` (last good pipeline run)  
**Broken State**: Current pipeline producing duplicates, missing units, wrong town assignments  
**Root Cause**: Quality scoring commit `3dda3b2` (2025-08-28 10:05:44) broke unit town parsing

**Working State Analysis**:
- Line 21: `Pack 0031 Shirley` ✅ Single clean entry (Shirley is full HNE town, not village)
- Line 23: `Pack 0033 Westminster` ✅ Present and working
- Line 24: `Pack 0034 Sterling` ✅ Present and working  
- Line 17: Only `Pack 0025 Princeton` ✅ (No problematic Uxbridge/Athol unit)
- Line 43: `Pack 0148 East Brookfield` ✅ Single clean entry
- Line 45: `Pack 0151 West Boylston` ✅ Single clean entry
- **Only Issue**: Troop 0132 missing (discarded due to Mendon meeting location)

**Current Broken Issues**:
- Westminster Pack 0033 ❌ Missing  
- Sterling Pack 0034 ❌ Missing
- Pack 0031 appears TWICE (Ayer and Shirley) ❌ Duplicates
- Pack 0025 showing as Athol instead of filtered out ❌ Wrong assignment
- Pack 0148 appears TWICE (Brookfield and East Brookfield) ❌ Duplicates
- Pack 0151 appears TWICE (Boylston and West Boylston) ❌ Duplicates

**IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**:

1. **Revert Quality Changes**: `git revert 3dda3b2 --no-edit`
2. **Test Against Reference**: Compare to `unit_identifier_debug_scraped_20250828_085755_u.log`
3. **Add Troop 0132 Fix**: Minimal Mendon→Upton exception only
4. **Test Again**: Verify stable baseline + Troop 0132
5. **Update Reference**: New stable baseline
6. **Reassess**: Plan quality improvements without breaking parsing

**Key User Insights**:
- User requested QUALITY_ADDRESS_EMPTY functionality (not RECOMMENDED_MISSING_ADDRESS)
- Quality scoring changes interfered with unit town parsing logic
- Shirley is full HNE town (from HNE_council_map.png), not village
- System was working perfectly except for Troop 0132 meeting location issue

**Critical Lesson**: Keep quality scoring (quality_scorer.py) completely separate from unit parsing logic (fixed_scraped_data_parser.py)

**Files Modified This Session (Need Revert)**:
- `src/parsing/fixed_scraped_data_parser.py` - Changes broke working system
- Quality scoring from commit `3dda3b2` - Root cause of regression

**Session Time**: Nearly 5-hour limit reached, auto-compact imminent
