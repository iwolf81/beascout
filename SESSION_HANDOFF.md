# BeAScout Project - Session Handoff Document

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Improve Scouting America unit information quality for Heart of New England Council (Massachusetts) by scraping, analyzing, and reporting on unit completeness from beascout.scouting.org.

**Repository**: https://github.com/iwolf81/beascout  
**Last Commit**: `2eef356` - "Implement data extraction and analysis with improved meeting information parsing"  
**Date**: August 22, 2025

## Current State Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed This Session
1. **Data Collection Framework**
   - Built working scraper using Playwright for dynamic content
   - Successfully captured HTML from beascout.scouting.org (10-mile radius, Acton MA)
   - Fixed browser launch issues with proper Chrome arguments

2. **Data Extraction & Analysis**
   - Developed comprehensive HTML analysis script (`analyze_data.py`)
   - Fixed critical extraction bug: Use `card-body` containers (66 units) not `unit-body` (132 duplicates)
   - Implemented proper deduplication logic handling 2x and 4x duplicate entries
   - Primary identifier parsing: 100% success rate using format `<unit type> <unit number> <chartered organization name>`

3. **Meeting Information Extraction**
   - **Meeting Day**: Improved from 9.7% ‚Üí 22.6% (captures "Friday", "Wednesday" from descriptions)
   - **Meeting Time**: Improved from broken ‚Üí 21.0% (handles "6:30pm", "7:00 - 8:30 p.m.")
   - **Meeting Location**: Achieved 87.1% (real addresses like "435 Central Street")

4. **Field Completeness Analysis**
   - Contact Person: 90.3% (56/62)
   - Contact Email: 83.9% (52/62)  
   - Website: 74.2% (46/62)
   - Description: 85.5% (53/62)

### üìä Current Data Coverage
- **Scope**: 10-mile radius around Acton, MA (ZIP 01720)
- **Units Found**: 66 total search results
- **Unique Units**: 62 (after deduplication)
- **Duplicate Units**: 4 units appearing multiple times (data quality issue for Key Three)

## Key Technical Discoveries

### HTML Structure Insights
```
Correct extraction path:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ div.card-body (66 containers) ‚Üê USE THIS
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ div.unit-body (actual data)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ div.unit-name (132 total, paired with containers)

Incorrect path:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ div.unit-body (132 containers) ‚Üê WRONG, creates duplicates
```

### Extraction Patterns That Work
```python
# Primary identifier parsing
"Pack 0070 Acton-Congregational Church"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit_type: "Pack"  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit_number: "0070"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chartered_organization: "Acton-Congregational Church"

# Meeting day patterns  
r'meets?\s+(?:most\s+)?(?:on\s+)?([A-Za-z]+day)s?'  # "meets most Wednesdays"

# Meeting time patterns
r'(\d{1,2}:\d{2})\s*-\s*(\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s*[ap]\.?m\.?)'  # "7:00 - 8:30 p.m."
```

### Critical Data Quality Finding
**Duplicate Units Detected** (requires Key Three action):
- Troop 0001 Troop One Stow Alumni Inc (4 occurrences)
- Troop 0081 Chelmsford Land Conservation Trust Inc (4 occurrences)  
- Troop 0135 Friends of Carlisle Scouting (4 occurrences)
- Troop 0194 Anthony Hunt Hamilton A .L. Post 221 (4 occurrences)

## Files & Artifacts

### Core Implementation
- `analyze_data.py` - Main analysis script with improved extraction logic
- `src/scrapers/beascout_scraper.py` - Working Playwright scraper
- `requirements.txt` - Fixed dependencies (removed sqlite3 error)

### Data Assets  
- `data/raw/debug_page_01720.html` - Captured HTML (550KB, 66 units)
- `data/raw/analysis_01720.json` - Structured extraction results
- `data/raw/data_analysis_summary.md` - Technical analysis findings

### Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project requirements and specifications
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design document
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Scale Data Collection (High Priority)
- Expand from 10-mile radius to full Heart of New England Council
- Identify all ZIP codes in council territory from https://hnescouting.org/about/
- Run scraper across all council ZIP codes to capture hundreds of units

### 2. Description Field Mining (High Priority)  
**Current Gap**: Rich meeting information exists in descriptions but isn't extracted
```
Examples from current data:
- "Pack meetings are the first Friday of the month at 6:30pm"
- "Meets most Wednesdays 7:00 - 8:30 p.m. when school is in session"
```

**Action Needed**: Develop advanced text parsing for:
- Meeting frequencies (weekly, monthly, seasonal)
- Location references within descriptions  
- Contact preferences and special instructions

### 3. Implement Duplicate Reporting (Medium Priority)
- Generate formal reports for Key Three members
- Highlight specific units needing database consolidation
- Create actionable recommendations with side-by-side duplicate comparisons

### 4. joinexploring.org Integration (Medium Priority)
- Implement scraper for Exploring units (20-mile radius)
- Similar extraction patterns but different website structure
- Combine with BeAScout data for complete council coverage

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Extraction Gaps
- Meeting locations still missing for some units despite addresses being present
- Unit composition extraction needs improvement (61.3% vs target higher)
- Phone number extraction limited (25.8%) - may need better patterns

### Technical Debt
- Temporary debug files (`check_duplicates.py`, `debug_extraction.py`) not committed
- Hard-coded ZIP code (01720) in analysis script needs parameterization
- No automated testing for extraction accuracy

## Development Environment Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iwolf81/beascout.git
cd beascout
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# Test current functionality
python analyze_data.py  # Analyzes existing captured data
```

## Success Metrics Achieved This Session
- ‚úÖ 100% primary identifier extraction (was 0%)
- ‚úÖ 87.1% meeting location extraction (was failing)  
- ‚úÖ 22.6% meeting day extraction (was 9.7%)
- ‚úÖ 21.0% meeting time extraction (was broken)
- ‚úÖ Proper 66-unit extraction (was 132 with duplicates)
- ‚úÖ Working end-to-end data pipeline established

## Context for Future Sessions
This session successfully established the **foundation for data-driven BeAScout analysis**. The extraction framework is working, HTML structure is understood, and initial patterns are captured. 

**Primary value delivered**: Converted from broken prototype to working analysis system with accurate unit extraction and meaningful completeness statistics.

**Ready for scale**: The next session should focus on expanding coverage to the full council and mining the rich information hidden in description fields.
